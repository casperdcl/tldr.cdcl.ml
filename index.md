Have an article you'd like distilled? [Send me a request!]({{ site.mailto_request }})

I summarise all key actionable items to reduce time-to-understand by paraphrasing to:

1. :scroll: reduce length/verbosity/repetition
2. :confounded: reduce complexity/jargon
   + without altering sentiment/plagiarising
   + (inject my own opinions/comments, typically in nested parenthesised bullets)
3. :page_facing_up: remove cruft/distractions (marketing, layout, fonts, ...)
   + (suppress my latent desire to add a relevant [xkcd](https://xkcd.com) comic)
4. :heavy_check_mark::warning::stop_sign: draw attention to important things with emojis
