Have an article you'd like distilled? [Send me a request!](mailto:casper.dcl@physics.org?subject=tldr.cdcl.ml%20request)

My approach is to summarise all key actionable items so nobody else has to bother reading the article.
Basically, reduce time-to-understand by paraphrasing to:

1. :scroll: reduce time to read
2. :confounded: reduce complexity/jargon without altering sentiment
   + :innocent: (inject my own opinions/comments, typically in nested parenthesised bullets)
3. :page_facing_up: remove cruft/distractions (marketing, layout, fonts, ...)
   + :see_no_evil: (suppress my latent desire to add a relevant [xkcd](https://xkcd.com) comic)
4. :white_tick::warning::stop_sign: draw attention to important things with emojis
