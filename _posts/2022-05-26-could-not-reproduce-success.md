Succeeded once; could not reproduce.

- success & experience does not guarantee a second success
- :stop_sign: "[existing solutions] were [...] not great, but just good enough [so] our USP was a nice to have and not a killer feature." Research showed people were interested in **looking** for solutions, but it just wasn't worth **solving** for enough potential customers
  + if there's no marked market response to a release, drop the failed idea quickly
  + :warning: if some customers are enthusiastic it might be because of a good customer support team rather than actual product value
- use contractors for mentoring, not development
- cap advertising spend based on profits
- :warning: [RFCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments)/ideation: take time to draft, then sit for weeks, then revisit every **few months** to check for persistent relevance & more insights. Do not rush to implementation
- :stop_sign: keep reminding about [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) definition regularly
  + Personally, I'd like to add to this... don't let implementation ease drive product evolution
