[Workflows](https://www.forbes.com/sites/servicenow/2020/03/11/three-steps-to-the-perfect-workflow/?sh=40a21be4618e) address tasks, processes address [business goals](https://thebusinessprofessor.com/en_US/management-leadership-organizational-behavior/goals-and-objectives-of-an-organization).

## Workflow

- usually ordered sequence of steps to complete a task ("tactical")
- :warning: each workflow may have multiple related processes (??)
- each workflow depends on processes
- at least partially [automated](https://levity.ai/blog/process-automation-benefits)
  + rule-based: fully automated so can take unlimited input without needing more employees
  + [congnitive](https://levity.ai/blog/what-is-cognitive-automation): requires human gathering/[structuring data](https://levity.ai/blog/structured-vs-unstructured-data)
    * but [AI can help automate](https://levity.ai/blog/find-processes-ai-can-automate)
- e.g. "get approval from each manager"

## Process

- meet a business goal ("strategic")
- :warning: each process usually has only 1 related workflow (??)

## Notes

I think the article mistakenly swapped the two (:warning:) points above. To me, a big-picture goal has many small tasks, not the other way around.
