"Replacing your job" is not the biggest problem with current {% glossary AI %}.

- "prompt engineering" (carefully framing AI inputs to maximise quality of outputs) might become a new "no code" human job
  + "negative prompts" can result in "AI [cryptids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptids)" and help explore AI model [latent space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_space) (personal opinion: related to {% glossary GIGO %})
- more training data & compute resources (rather than developments in the underlying fundamental theory) is driving current AI popularity
  + current training needs an obscene amount of electricity
- widespread unlicenced appropriation of data to train AI might fall under "fair use" laws in the US but is likely illegal in the EU
  + people whose work was "stolen" are still often happy to use the resultant AI "product"
  + (personal opinion) consuming something despite awareness of issues seems similar to unhealthy addiction
- it's dangerous to believe that current AI is actually intelligent (rather than a curator of pre-existing data)
  + outputs are [often dangerously wrong/misleading]({% post_url 2023-01-05-gpt-is-a-toy %})
- current AI could replace even some "creative" human jobs
  + (personal opinion) such jobs were never truly "creative" to begin with
- "[Data is the last frontier of colonisation](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/22/1050394/artificial-intelligence-for-the-people)"
- "Intelligence is a poor thing when it is imagined by corporations [mostly seeking] profit maximisation [of] shareholder value [at the expense of] artistic, imaginative, aesthetic and emotional expressions"
- "We deserve better from the tools we use, the media we consume and the communities we live within"
- "Technology is what we can learn to do"
