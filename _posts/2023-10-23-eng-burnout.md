Things managers should do.

1. :handshake: trust engineers
   + don't question every implementation detail
   + allow engineers to drive some requirements/scope (assuming this leads to promotion)
2. :zap: avoid heavyweight (non-[agile](% post_url 2022-12-19-aggressive-agile %)) processes
   + process which work for BigTech will fail at {% glossary SME, display: SMEs %}/startups
3. :shipit: ship fast & often
   + good: imperfect releases with feedback loops
   + bad: never-ending delays
   + "*perfectionism is often an excuse for procrastination*"
4. :rocket: under-promise & over-deliver
   + provide clear vision (product's problem-and-solution)
