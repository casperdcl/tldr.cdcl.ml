> Source: <https://a16z.com/2022/06/09/the-cloud-killed-infrastructure-long-live-infrastructure>. Both generalist competition and specialised products are increasing.

- entire companies can be built around task-specific cloud tech
  + apps are increasingly loosely coupled i.e. work on any cloud
  + the market is large enough for specialism
- the underlying generalist clouds are too generic to deliver good time-to-value and value-for-money
- companies are shifting from fear of AWS/GCP/Azure competing to actively competing with them
- examples:
  + letting front-end devs build cloud tech (e.g. [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org)), increasingly enabled by CDNs (e.g. [Fly.io](https://fly.io), [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com))
  + AI/ML-specific hardware (e.g [MosaicML](https://www.mosaicml.com))
  + high-level full stack apps (e.g. Mighty chrome-fork [remote desktop](https://mightyviewer.com))
