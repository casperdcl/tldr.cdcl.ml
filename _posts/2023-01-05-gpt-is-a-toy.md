Current {% glossary AI %} bots are A but not I.

- output is fluent (grammar/syntax) but uninteresting (meaning)
  + structure & style: formulaic/rule-based
  + content & meaning: engaging in the context of AI, but *terrible* in the context of publication-worthy professional prose
- AI is (currently) a toy or (aesthetic not epistemological) instrument to play with
  + a new interface to a pre-existing large training corpus
    * :mag: search engine: understanding human grammar/syntax in queries [where Google fails](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/06/google-search-algorithm-internet/661325)
  + can't replace schools or publications
- [OpenAI](http://openai.com) released [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT) as a demo/experiment without giving use-cases
  + does not claim accuracy, creativity, nor veracity
  + prompting ChatGPT for better response quality leads to it making excuses reminiscent of "a student [complaining] about their grade" or admitting it is wrong
- "we are drowning in an ocean of content", "faking it with words" and current AI is going to make it worse

### personal observations

- humanity's biggest intellectual problem is the overwhelming deluge of poor content (quantity over quality)
  + ergo [this blog](/) summarises/distils into high-density (quality over quantity)
- misleading content generated by ChatGPT when asked to criticise itself:
  + "*lacks ability to understand complexity of language*" -- not true, grammar & syntax is easy for AI to grok
  + "*outsourcing human conversations to a machine could have detrimental side effects on our society*" -- not true, the far bigger problem is low-quality machine output being blindly treated as high-quality (more often than low-quality human output is treated as high-quality)
- other legitimate use cases of current AI
  + :robot: responding to the worst humans: people who call emergency numbers without a real emergency deserve no better than the current equally brainless AI
  + :confounded: highlighting confusing text: if the AI's re-explanation of your existing text (in its own words) is horribly wrong, consider rewording/simplifying your text
  + :scroll: [writer's block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writer%27s_block): horrible AI placeholder text can prompt/inspire you
