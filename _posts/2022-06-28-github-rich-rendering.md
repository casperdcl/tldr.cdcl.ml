GitHub renders more than just code.

The following are supported:

- various image diff modes (side-by-side, swipe, blend)
- `*.stl` 3D models, incl. webGL acceleration & inline
- `*.csv` & `*.tsv` tables, incl. searching
- `*.geojson` & `*.topojson` maps, incl. inline
- `*.ipynb` Jupyter Notebooks
  + in my experience often need to refresh a few times to load properly)
- `*.mermaid` & `*.mmd` flowcharts, incl. inline
- `*.pdf`
