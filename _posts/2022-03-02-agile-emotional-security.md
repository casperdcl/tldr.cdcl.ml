Mental health, communication, openness, and a supportive culture are important.

- Agile fails if people fail to communicate
- "Individuals and interactions (i.e. culture) over processes and tools"
- people need to be comfortable with admitting mistakes, being outvoted, receiving criticism (retrospectives, postmortems etc.)
- should never be "emotionally and politically expensive to speak up"
