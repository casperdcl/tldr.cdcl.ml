Fix knee, back, & breathing issues.

1. :athletic_shoe: delay lifting the back foot, making you peel it off the ground as if showing the person behind your soles
   + (seems to imply front foot should never bee far ahead of the rest of the body)
2. :speaking_head: look up, don't lean forward, don't hunch down
3. :muscle: let the arms swing naturally on their own
