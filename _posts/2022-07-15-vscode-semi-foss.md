> Source: <https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium#why-does-this-exist>. Interesting release/licensing strategy.

- vscode is [public/MIT](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/blob/master/LICENSE)
- but released binaries are augmented with MS proprietary code, branding, telemetry etc. and [non-FLOSS](https://code.visualstudio.com/license)
