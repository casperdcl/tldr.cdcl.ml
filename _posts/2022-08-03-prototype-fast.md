Product management focused on *rapid prototyping* (somewhere between *thinking aloud* and *making a polished product*). Applicable to software, hardware, and even organisational design.

1. :mortar_board: nurture culture of learning
   + "reward success/punish failure" blame culture is more harmful to productivity than lack of tools/techniques
   + instead focus on learning *why* something is/isn't successful
   + learning is more important :warning: than success
   + avoid conjecture-based debates by quickly prototyping real things to test
2. :sweat: minimise processes/overheads
   + it's hard to paint a masterpiece if you also have to create & present a slideshow, pitch to stakeholders, write a formal spec, etc.
   + programmers/graphics designers: focus on effect on "human behaviour" (i.e. user experience, [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)) rather than code/pixels
   + product managers: focus on managing uncertainty
3. :hourglass: minimise iteration time
   + need a cycle: prototype -> release -> :warning: feedback/learning from stakeholders/customers -> prototype ...
     * :bulb: build in non-negotiable customer feedback time twice a week
   + need to cycle (iterate) fast (days not months)
4. :star_struck: target enthusiasm
   + find "Eyes Light Up" magic moments
   + the product *is* such moments
     * e.g. "press button to order car & leave without paying" is magic, "Uber login & payment flow" is not
     * product isn't *the world* -- it *gets used* in the world
   + increase frequency & impact of such moments
5. :repeat: when starting new projects, design for adaptability over scalability/stability
   + focus on dev culture
   + assume most of the initial (hacky) implementation will be thrown out
   + decide *what* to do fast/first, refine/polish/scale later
