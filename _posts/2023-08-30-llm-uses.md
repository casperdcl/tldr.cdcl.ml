Some real-world "use cases" (half of which I disagree with).

1. :mag: Retrieval/Search
   - both inter- & intra-document (find doc in corpus & find in doc)
   - semantic matching (rather than keyword matching & link analysis)
   - e.g. [DropBox Dash](https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/product/introducing-AI-powered-tools), [CommandBar HelpHub](https://helphub.commandbar.com)
   - (personal opinion) [seems a valid use case provided the output includes verifiable citations to original source][gpt-toy]
2. :scroll: Summarisation/Classification
   - both inter- & intra-doc (whole-doc & per-paragraph)
   - e.g. [Notion "Summarise"](https://www.notion.so), [Superpowered](https://superpowered.me)
   - (personal opinion) [danger is users are very likely to assume 100% accuracy][gpt-toy]
3. :mag: Structured translation (for machine APIs)
   - e.g. [Booking.com "Trip Planner"](https://globalnews.booking.com/bookingcom-launches-new-ai-trip-planner-to-enhance-travel-planning-experience), [Linear "AI Filters"](https://linear.app/changelog/2023-06-01-ai-filters)
   - (personal opinion) identical to *1. Retrieval/Search*, except with formatted (e.g. JSON) outputs -- so not a separate use case
4. :confounded: Unstructured translation (for human users)
   - proofreading, [paraphrasing], explaining, refactoring
   - e.g. [Mutiny](https://www.mutinyhq.com), [Replit "Ghostwriter"](https://replit.com/site/ghostwriter)
   - (personal opinion) "explaining" quality is currently unusably poor
   - (personal opinion) "proofreading/paraphrasing" quality is currently poor so [only useful in the context of "highlighting confusing text"][gpt-toy]
5. :warning: Text Generation
   - e.g. [Jasper AI](https://www.jasper.ai), [Tome](https://tome.app)
   - (personal opinion) :scream: this is terrible. {% glossary AI %} [is not][gpt-toy] {% glossary AGI %}, so is incapable of generation. It can paraphrase (at best) or plagiarise (at worst) -- falling foul of fraud, misrepresentation, & IP theft laws.
