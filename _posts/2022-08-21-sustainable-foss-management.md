Maintaining {% glossary FOSS %} projects without burning out; and contributing successfully.

- goals
  + :recycle: **maintainability/sustainability**: keep project manageable
  + :zap: **progress**: always iterating forward
  + :timer_clock: **efficiency**: avoid wasting time
- set direction/plan roadmap
  + :crossed_swords: tension between expanding vs sustainably maintaining (esp. for larger projects)
- issue/ticket trackers
  + :+1: there will always be contributors (opening valid issues)
  + :-1: maintainers have too limited time/attention to action everything
  + :inbox_tray: (typically) aim for a manageable number of (rather than zero) issues
  + :twisted_rightwards_arrows: treat as *priority-* rather than *check-*list
    * judge what is (not) important
    * close based on likelihood of being addressed *soon* rather than *ever* (could reassess & reopen later)
      * :thinking: (personal opinion) I think this discourages contributors & produces duplicate issues/fragmented discussion/lost problems. Instead I'd use [milestones](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones)/[project boards](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects) to collect "being addressed soon" issues, while [labelling](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels) unresolvable/low-priority things appropriately
    * prioritising one issue means de-prioritising another
  + :scroll: stop accepting new issues altogether if too many to manage
    * :scream: (personal opinion) I'd trim *prioritised* issues instead
    * set goal of tackling 1 per day
  + :warning: when closing, mention willingness to (re)consider further suggestions
- :loudspeaker: communicate everything clearly & constantly to contributors
- :angel: contributors
  + should ideally close more issues than they open
  + solve an issue as "payment" for opening another?
  + try to minimise maintainers' required effort
