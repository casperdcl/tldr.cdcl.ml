Levels:

1. no plan
2. recreate office online
3. real-time shared documents, spontaneous chats, default meeting length 15 min w. only necessary attendees + agenda + action items, never meet if a message would suffice
4. async comm: include background + due date + links to more info (in messages)
5. no office-based team could compete
