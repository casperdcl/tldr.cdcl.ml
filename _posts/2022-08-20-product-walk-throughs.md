Address what makes the product better than alternatives.

- :zzz: don't waste time on mundane (non-{% glossary USP %}) features
- :scroll: don't be too feature-focused
- :1st_place_medal: address value compared to competitors & alternative approaches; "why pick you?"
- :moneybag: important for sales reps, customers, and revenue

1. intro real problem & trade-offs of current solutions (incl. the proposed solution)
2. context (to understand product & unique features)
3. structure around {% glossary USP %} value, and reduce/omit explanation of non-USP values
4. proof of value (e.g. statistics, customer references, quotes)
5. future steps (e.g. schedule follow-up meeting, make a {% glossary PoC %}, get a quote)
