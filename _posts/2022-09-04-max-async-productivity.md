Maximising flexible/asynchronous work is key to remote productivity.

- :warning: managers often give mixed messages, officially encouraging flexible hours *without meaning it* (signalling/promoting the opposite)
  + results in worst of both worlds: bad work-life balance + midnight message checks -- without benefits of autonomy & control over your time -- leading to burnout & poor talent retention
- :hourglass: workers often waste >1h/day on "[productivity theatre](https://language.work/research/killing-time-at-work)/digital presenteeism/killing time"
  + joining meetings knowing they will be worthless
  + responding to emails at strategically selected hours
  + being ostentatiously online to convince colleagues you're working long/hard
- :zzz: resting/relaxing/doing personal chores is better than pretending to work, ironically resulting in better long term productivity
  + stop thinking of "appearing online" as a substitute for "being in-office"
- :twisted_rightwards_arrows: remote work without maximising flexible/async is pointless
  + no need to have set office hours
  + build work around lives, not the other way around
  + produces better quality
  + have sync meetings only if required
