If you like it, drink it.

- **constituents**: [supertasters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supertaster) (circa 25% of people) can consistently identify subtle flavours in wines
- **preference**: most (including ~90% of competition judges) disagree -- even with themselves on repeat tests -- on quality ranking
  + (personal note: also, why should the 10% elite consensus matter to you? You drink for your own nuanced tastebuds and wear clothes your size; not someone else's)
- **objectivity**: tastebuds are easily fooled by expectations, circumstance, and random chance
  + people can also be easily deliberately fooled
  + (personal note: "flavour" is typically [scientifically understood to include smell, temperature, texture, etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste#Further_sensations_and_transmission) -- e.g. an orange segment does not "taste" the same if eaten while holding your nose -- so ambience could be more important than chemical components to reproduce a "flavour")
