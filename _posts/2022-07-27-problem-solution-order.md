A hammer seems pointless if you've never seen a nail.

- solutions seem pointless if the corresponding problem/purpose isn't clear... even if the problem is encountered later
- it's better to first demonstrate the problem before introducing a solution
- examples
  + video gamers who find a locked door before finding a key make the logical connection (use key to unlock door) more often than those who find the key first
  + children often hate the (advanced) mathematics taught in school because it often seems pointless
  + [functional programming monads](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)>) are arguably simple, yet newcomers find them difficult... because they try to learn what they are *are* rather than what they're *for*
