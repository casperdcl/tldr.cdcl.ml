"Agile" is a *mindset*, not a process/methodology.

- pragmatic-vs-purist-debate is invalid (because "agile" is a *mindset*)
- everyone has a different understanding of the agile manifesto
- mindset
  + you can learn anything
  + you persevere over frustration
  + you learn from failures
  + your are inspired (not threatened) by others' success
  + your effort/attitude (not abilities/smartness) determines success
- aims
  + happiness
  + money (revenue)
  + keep customers happy
  + reduce & avoid costs (use cloud & open source, have small teams/avoid over-hiring)
  + high-quality productivity (small practical innovations, e.g.: suggesting new tool, moving meeting times)
  + [safe environment]({% post_url 2022-03-02-agile-emotional-security %}) for experimentation (more than just 1 {% glossary PoC %})
- anti-patterns: the following are NOT agile
  + multiple code & test sprints before something is ready for production
  + feature in production isn't used because it's not hardened (scalable, secure, optimised) enough
  + separate UX and dev sprints
- [scrum guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html): time to deliver to production should be ~weeks
- team should regularly reflect & adjust behaviour
- agile coaching
  + don't confuse training (syllabus), consultancy (prescriptive), mentoring (experienced-based), with coaching (ask questions, let team propose solutions, eventually self-coaching so separate coach not needed)
  + build rapport, identify issues, clarify/explore, design action, support & reward action
- scaling frameworks (e.g. [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com), [Disciplined Agile](https://www.pmi.org/disciplined-agile), [LeSS](https://less.works)) focus on process & methodology instead of mindset & culture
  + people with agile mindsets will LEAVE when these processes are (wor)shipped
