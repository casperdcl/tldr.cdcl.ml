Middle management ideas to make remote work a moral necessity rather than a culture-killer.

- remote work is successful for old trusted employees with defined roles; new employees feel like they've joined a group chat rather than a company
- hard to promote a wholesome company culture
- easy to misunderstand chat messages & emojis
- less likely to have small talk/passing conversations
- [causes more intra-team & less inter-team messaging](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/09/offices-microsoft-study-out-group-connections/620137) so less serendipitous knowledge sharing & innovation
  + [face-to-face interactions correlate with unique patent citations](https://www.nber.org/papers/w30147)
- virtual teams have [fewer & less creative](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04643-y) ideas
- harder to build trust (required for effective collaboration) virtually
- :tada: solutions (for middle managers to enact)
  + decide why & when things need to be in-person vs async/remote
  + form new groups for new ideas
  + intentional structured mentorship programs
  + plan retreats/events
- (not explicitly stated in the article but heavily implied) be international
  + multinational (virtual) academic collaborations [have become more innovative over the last decade](https://voxeu.org/article/how-remote-collaboration-impacts-innovation) than non-virtual ones
  + (personal opinion) remote = no need to restrict talent to one city/country
