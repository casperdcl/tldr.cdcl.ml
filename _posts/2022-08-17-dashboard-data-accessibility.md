A dashboard is not just an interface; but proof of data {% glossary CRUD %} & comparison.

- :warning: dashboards are *not* for a "CEO [to see] pretty graphs [for] making real-time [business] decisions"
- :zap: dashboards *do* demonstrate (easy) data access
  + live & historic data
  + comparative metrics
  + connect/unify multiple databases
  + external data sources
- :bulb: accessible + comparable + trackable = actionable
- :stop_sign: alternative is bad: trapped/locked data = useless
  + spreadsheets
  + multiple logins walls
  + multiple (incompatible) formats
