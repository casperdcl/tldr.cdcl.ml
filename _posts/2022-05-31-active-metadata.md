The article is bit abstract & unclear, but the lists seem to contain some info.

- What is "active" metadata?
> 1. Improved context of [metadata powering data discovery](https://atlan.com/platform/data-catalog)
> 2. Auto-generated [data quality & lineage impact](https://atlan.com/platform/data-lineage-governance) analysis
> 3. Auto-classification of sensitive data enabling [easy governance & compliance](https://atlan.com/platform/data-lineage-governance)
> 4. Making embedded collaboration possible
> 5. [Orchestration of metadata](https://atlan.com/data-orchestration-101) across platforms
- requirements:
> - import & export metadata & workflows
> - use ML to recommend job flows, resource allocation, etc.
> - cross-platform metadata analysis
- features:
> 1. always on
> 2. don't just collect metadata, create intelligence
> 3. don't stop at intelligence: drive action
> 4. API-driven embedded collaboration
- components:
> 1. **metadata lake**: unified (raw & processed) storage repo built on open APIs
> 2. **Programmable bots**: users can create custom DS/ML algorithms
> 3. **collaboration plugins**: integrations unified by a common metadata layer, seamlessly integrates data tools with each data team's daily workflow.
> 4. **Data process automation**: easy way to build/deploy/manage workflow automation bots, emulating human decision-making
> 5. **Reverse metadata**: make relevant metadata available to the end-user "rather than in a standalone catalog"
