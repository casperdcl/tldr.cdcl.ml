Effective teamwork through knowledge rather than fear.

1. **understanding**: curiosity about others' viewpoints
2. **introspection**: know thy own biases
3. **privilege**: acknowledgement of (lack of) unfair advantages
4. **empathetic communication**: use vocabulary & tone to circumvent others' biases/walls of defence without triggering fear/judgement
5. **honesty**: feeling safe to disagree
6. **support**: sourcing candid feedback
7. **mentorship**: encouraging withdrawn/quiet people to engage

(PS: note that simply "*being nice*" is neither a means nor an end, and is not mentioned in any of the above advice. Feigning niceness -- whilst you rage inside -- will result in a nervous breakdown or a homicidal explosion.)
