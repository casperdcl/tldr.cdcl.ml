For public safety, governments should incentivise warranties/support/maintenance for widely-used {% glossary FOSS %}.

- FOSS licences
  + are on a spectrum of open/permissive (e.g. [OSI](https://opensource.org)) to restrictive (e.g. [HPL](https://firstdonoharm.dev) bespoke/optional clauses)
  + don't address (lack of) practical enforceability over billions of end users
  + don't provide warranties/safety, [even if critical]({% post_url 2022-07-24-linux-foss-warranty %})
- problems with ethos
  + free users are not paid customers, so are not covered by consumer protection laws
  + releasing source for public review/maintenance is not a substitute for basic warranties/support
  + large userbases are equivalent to "the general public"
  + developers of widely-used FOSS libraries can break the world (e.g. [`faker.js`, `colors.js`](https://www.theregister.com/2022/01/10/npm_fakerjs_colorsjs), [`left-pad`](https://www.theregister.com/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos), [xkcd#2347](https://xkcd.com/2347)) or face expensive suits (e.g. [NGINX](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/12/russian-media-group-rambler-attempting-to-hold-nginx-hostage))
- proposal: encourage/incentivise developers of widely-used FOSS libraries to provide {% glossary LTS %}/basic warranties
  + governments & {% glossary NGO, display: NGOs %} should sponsor support contracts purely in interest of public safety
    * current honours/awards/grants/knighthoods mainly focus on work with physical impact; not software
    * see e.g. [TideLift](https://tidelift.com)
