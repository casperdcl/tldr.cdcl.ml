The greatest invention (past, present, and future) is the Internet.

- :bulb: humans are separated from animals by knowledge
- :speaking_head: knowledge is primarily acquired via communication
- :twisted_rightwards_arrows: communication is made (trivially) realtime, async, omnipresent, "embarrassingly parallel" by the internet
- :speech_balloon: any "comments box" is a node into the resultant immortal "brain cloud" of current & future generations
- :zap: at best, future innovations can only optimise the internet, so cannot be considered greater inventions
